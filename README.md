# Random Number Generator

This project generates random numbers according to different probability distributions and plots histograms to visualize the distribution of the generated numbers.

## Features

- Generates random numbers using various probability distributions:
  - Uniform (int)
  - Uniform (double)
  - Normal
  - Exponential
  - Geometric
- Supports different sample sizes for each distribution.
- Utilizes `random` and `numpy.random` libraries in Python.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/random-number-generator.git

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib

3. **Run the 'random_number_generator.py' script**:

   ```bash
   python random_number_generator.py

4. **Enter your group number when prompted**.

## Usage
- Upon running the script, you will be prompted to enter your group number.
- The program will generate random numbers for different distributions and sample sizes.
- Histograms depicting the distribution of the generated numbers will be plotted and saved as PNG files in the project directory.

## Example
Here is an example of the generated histograms:

- Uniform (int)
- Uniform (double)
- Normal
- Exponential
- Geometric
